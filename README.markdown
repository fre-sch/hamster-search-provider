Search and start Hamster Activities.

Done:

*   Basic search results for activities.
*   Using DBus interface.
*   Starting activities.
*   Improve searching/matching.
*   Stop current activity, search for "stop@current".
*   Fix bug with Timestamps being UTC

Todo:

*   Start hamster-service if not running.
*   Feedback (Notifications).

Ideas:

*   Display current activity as active.
*   Prettier display of activities?
*   Activating running activity show Hamster ui to edit message?
*   Tags, do something with Hamster's tags...
