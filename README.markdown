### hamster-search-provider@gnome-shell-extensions.fre-sch.github.com

Search and start Hamster Activities.

Done:

*    Basic search results for activities.

*    Starting activities
*    Improve searching/matching

Todo:

*   Start hamster-service if not running
*   Feedback (Notifications)

Ideas:

*   Implement stopping current activity?
